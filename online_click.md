Click the + icon next to the trigger.
Select Gmail.
Choose the action “Send a message”.

Step 3: Connect Gmail Account
Sign in with your Gmail account.

Step 4: Configure Email Details Fill the required fields:
To: Receiver email address
Subject: Email subject (example: “Workflow Test Message”)
Message Body: Write the message content (example: “This email is sent automatically when the workflow is executed.”)

Step 5: Save the Workflow
Click Save.
Ensure the connection line appears between trigger and Gmail action.

Step 6: Test the Workflow
Click Execute workflow.
The system triggers the process.
Gmail automatically sends the configured email to the recipient.
